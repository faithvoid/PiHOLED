# PiHOLED
PiHOLED is a basic, no frills Python script to display PiHole &amp; Raspberry Pi hardware statistics on SH1106-based 1.3 inch (128x64) OLED display HATs, such as the Waveshare 1.3inch OLED Raspberry Pi HAT (can be modified to run on SSD1306-based HATs). Tested on a Raspberry Pi Zero W running DietPi but should theoretically work on any SBC + distro combination with a similar GPIO pinout.

## Requirements:
- SPI + I2C enabled in DietPi/Raspbian (or similar distro)
- python3
- python3-pip
- libopenjp2-7
- psutil (pip)
- requests (pip)
- luma.oled (pip)

To install these on DietPi, install Python & RPi.GPIO via the DietPi Software installer & afterwards type "sudo apt install libopenjp2-7 && pip3 install psutil requests luma.oled" into your terminal. 

For non-DietPi users, type "sudo apt install python3 python3-pip libopenjp2-7 && pip3 install psutil requests luma.oled" instead, and modify the .service file to reflect your username.

## How to install:
- Download PiHOLED or PiHOLED-WiFi (depending on whether you're using a wired or wireless connection)
- Copy the corresponding PiHOLED.py to your /home/dietpi directory
- Edit PiHOLED.py & replace <YOURAUTHTOKEN> with your the contents of "WEBPASSWORD" in "/etc/pihole/setupVars.con".
- Copy the PiHOLED.service script to /lib/systemd/system
- Type "systemctl enable PiHOLED && systemctl start PiHOLED"
- (Optional) To flip the screen, change "flip_screen = False" to "flip_screen = True" in PiHOLED.py. 

## How to use with SSD1306-based HAT:
- Open PiHOLED.py in Nano or a similar text editor
- Change these two lines to the following:
- "from luma.oled.device import sh1106" -> "from luma.oled.device import ssd1306"
- device = sh1106(serial, width=WIDTH, height=HEIGHT)  -> "device = ssd1306(serial, width=WIDTH, height=HEIGHT)"

## TBD:
- Add randomized 128-character inspirational quotes as the last line using "random" library.
- Add joystick/button support + add shutdown/restart options.

## Bugs:
- TBA
